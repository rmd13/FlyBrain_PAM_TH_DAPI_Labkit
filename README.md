# FlyBrain_PAM_TH_DAPI_Labkit
Predict the dopaminergic neuron's cell bodies in the PAM cluster of Drosophila brain stained with anti-TH antibody.

# Materials required:
1. z-stacks of Drosophila brain PAM cluster image on anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase(TH) channel and DAPI channel, with a image size x=512, y=512, z between 10 and 25, with an interval of 0.34 um. The PAM cluster from one half of brain was freely rotated and zoomed when necessary to fit the entire PAM cluster into the image region. Avoid overexposure.
2. Matlab (Mathwork).
3. Fiji/Imagej[https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads], with labkit[https://imagej.net/imagej-wiki-static/Labkit] installed.

# Installation
Add the Correct_Labkit_TH.m into Matlab searching path.
